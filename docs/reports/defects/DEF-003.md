# DEF-003 — Songs attempt to load on /rank without filter

## Summary  
On first load of `/rank`, the app begins fetching songs automatically with default filters (`pop / all / all`) even though the user has not pressed *Apply*. This leads to continuous background fetches before any user interaction.

## Environment  
- App: [Melodex live](www.melodx.io) 
- Commit: `6a951eb`  
- Browser: `Firefox 142.0.1 (desktop)`
- Device: `Windows 11 laptop`  
- Network:`Spectrum (approx 450 up / 11 down)` 
- Date/Time: `09-18-2025`

## Preconditions  
- User is authenticated with any log in options.  
- Navigate to `/rank` directly without setting any filters.  

## Steps to Reproduce  
1. Log into melodex.io with a valid account.  
2. Go directly to `/rank` without selecting filters.  
3. Observe network/console activity.  

## Expected Result  
No songs should be fetched until the user explicitly chooses filters and clicks *Apply*.  

## Actual Result  
- `SongProvider` triggers background fetch immediately on mount.  
- Default filter values (`pop / all / all`) are applied implicitly.  
- Multiple fetch loops occur, buffering ~13–15 songs each cycle.  
- Occasional timeouts logged (`DOMException: The operation was aborted`).  

## Impact  
- Backend is hit with unnecessary API requests, leading to wasted network calls and error logs.  
- Perceived reliability is reduced due to visible timeouts in console.  

## Attachments  
- HAR: [DEF-003-network](../evidence/DEF-003-network.har)
- Screenshot/GIF: [DEF-003-rank](../evidence/DEF-003-rank.png)
- Console log: [DEF-003-console](../evidence/DEF-003-console.txt)

## Triage  
- Severity: **Minor** (affects core ranking UX, but not blocking navigation)  
- Priority: **Medium** (should be fixed promptly but not release-blocking)  

## Suspected Areas  
- `SongProvider` useEffect lifecycle hook  
- Filter state initialization logic (default values applied as “selected”)  
- Background fetch trigger conditions not checking for “Apply” action  

## Diagnostics (what we tried)  
- Observed console logs: repeated `Triggering background fetch for more songs` entries.  
- Confirmed auth context resolves mid-sequence, but fetch starts even before user context is available.  
- Reproduced on multiple browsers and network conditions.  

## Proposed Fix (initial)  
- Add guard: only trigger background fetch when user explicitly applies filters.  
- Treat default state as “unset” rather than as valid filter selection.  
- Add regression test to ensure no fetch occurs on initial load.
