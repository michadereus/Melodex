# DEF-004 — Post-Spotify consent returns to `/rankings` without auto-opening Export

## Summary
After approving Spotify access (login + consent), the app redirected back to `/rankings` but **landed on the standard Rankings view**. The user had to click **Export to Spotify** a second time to reopen the export UI. Expected behavior is to **auto-open the Export panel** upon return so the user can continue the in-progress export without additional clicks.

## Environment
- **App:** `Melodex` (local dev)  
- **Commit:** `333d6ca`  
- **Browser:** `Firefox` (desktop)  
- **Device:** `Windows 11`  
- **Network:** `Spectrum` (~450 up / 11 down)  
- **Date/Time:** `2025-11-10`  

## Triage
- **Severity:** Minor → **Major** (minor if context is retained; **major** when context is lost)  
- **Priority:** **High** (affects first-time and re-auth flows universally)

## Preconditions
- Valid Spotify account.  
- User begins export from `/rankings` (some items selected, optional name/description entered).

## Steps to Reproduce (original)
1. On `/rankings`, click **Export to Spotify**.  
2. In Spotify, complete login and click **Agree** to grant scopes.  
3. Observe redirect back to the app at `/rankings`.  

## Expected Result
- App resumes the export flow automatically: Export UI opens after OAuth with previous context (checked items, name/description) intact.

## Actual Result  
- Page returns to `/rankings` showing the standard Rankings view.  
- User must click Export to Spotify again to proceed.  

## Impact
- Increases friction in a critical conversion path.  
- Heightens risk of lost context (e.g., description text, selections).  
- Potentially increases abandonment if combined with separate export errors.

## Attachments
- Console breadcrumb: `Local dev: overriding Amplify redirect URLs`  
- Server trace showing `/auth/session` 200 followed by return to `/rankings` without auto-open (LINK)  
- Short screen capture of the double-click requirement (LINK)  

## Suspected Areas
- Missing/ignored export intent on the OAuth round-trip (`returnTo` / state).  
- `/rankings` mount logic not consuming an intent flag to open Export.  
- Over-eager `/auth/session` gating causing re-auth loops in some statuses.  
- Filters not preserved in redirect, making the post-return view feel reset.   

## Diagnostics
- Reproduced consistently with a personal Spotify account.  
- Observed `/auth/session` → **200** prior to the second manual click.  
- Verified redirect lands on `/rankings` without selection UI automatically opening.

## Root Cause
1. **Intent not persisted:** The client initiated `/auth/start` without a durable export intent (e.g., `returnTo=/rankings?export=1` or equivalent state). After OAuth, `/rankings` mounted with no signal to auto-open Export.  
2. **Loop-prone gating:** Client treated ambiguous `/auth/session` outcomes (e.g., `304`, parse issues) as “not connected”, occasionally re-triggering `/auth/start` and preventing the resume path.  
3. **Filter context not carried:** Active `genre/subgenre` were not appended to `returnTo`, so the view appeared reset even when the user had filtered before export.

## Changes
- **OAuth intent carry & resume**  
    - Build `returnTo=/rankings?export=1` when sending the user to `/auth/start`; also drop a fallback sessionStorage intent flag to survive provider quirks.  
    - On return to `/rankings`, consume `export=1` or the intent flag and auto-open selection mode, seeding visible items.
    - After opening, clean `?export=1` from the URL (avoid sticky behavior on refresh).  
- **Session check hardening**  
    - `ensureSpotifyConnected()` now uses `cache:'no-store'` and only redirects for **401/403** or explicit `{ connected:false }`.  
    - Ambiguous statuses (e.g., `304`, `204`, transient 5xx with parsable body) are treated as connected to prevent auth loops.
- **Filter persistence**  
    - Include current `genre` / `subgenre` in `returnTo` so the post-OAuth list matches the pre-OAuth view.  
    - Rankings initial fetch reads filters from `location.search` instead of forcing defaults.  
- **Minor QoL**  
    - Stabilized selection-mode open path and seeded default playlist name deterministically.  

## Verification
1. **Integration:**  
    - **IT-Auth-OAuthResume (new):** `/auth/callback` → `/auth/session {connected:true}` → auto-open Export on `/rankings?export=1` without a second click.  
2. **E2E:**  
    - **E2E-Export-OAuth-Resume (new):** Start from `/rankings?genre=pop&subgenre=any`; after consent, Export opens automatically and the same filters are applied. No repeated `/auth/start` and no extra click is required.  
3. **Manual:**  
    - Confirm no re-auth loop; confirm `?export=1` is removed post-open; confirm selections/name/description persist where applicable.

**Verified in:** `98fd350` on `2025-12-12`  
**Verification Status:** Pass
