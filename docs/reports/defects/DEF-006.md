# DEF-006 — Spotify OAuth session reused across Melodex account switch

## Summary
After logging out of one Melodex account and signing into another, the app continued to treat the second user as already connected to Spotify, even though that user had never granted Spotify access.  
Starting an export did not prompt the Spotify login/consent screen. Instead, the export used the Spotify account from the previous Melodex user.

## Environment
- **App:** Melodex (local dev)  
- **Commit:** `4db0a3e`  
- **Browser:** Firefox (desktop)  
- **Device:** Windows 11  
- **Network:** Spectrum (~450 up / 11 down)  
- **Date/Time:** 2025-11-13  

## Triage
- **Severity:** Critical  
- **Priority:** High  

## Preconditions
- Melodex **User A** is logged in and has completed Spotify OAuth (login + consent).  
- Export works normally for User A.  
- Melodex logout is performed using the app’s Google sign-out flow.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Log in as **User A** (Melodex).  
2. Complete Spotify login and grant access when prompted.  
3. Log out of Melodex.  
4. Log in as **User B** (Melodex) who has never connected a Spotify account.  
5. On **/rankings**, click **Export to Spotify**.

## Expected Result
- User B should be prompted to log into Spotify.  
- If User B uses a different Spotify account, that account should be associated with User B’s Melodex session.  
- `/auth/session` should reflect the correct authorization state for User B.

## Actual Result
- No Spotify prompt appears.  
- `/auth/session` immediately reports `connected:true` for User B.  
- Export uses User A’s Spotify account without any re-authentication.  
- No mechanism resets Spotify tokens between Melodex users.

## Impact
- Critical cross-account authorization leak.   
- Incorrect playlists may be created under the wrong Spotify user.  
- User B has access to actions that require User A’s prior authorization.  
- Violates expected OAuth isolation between users.

(Commit and PR to be added once completed.)

## Root Cause
- Spotify provider cookies remained active after Melodex logout, preserving the previous Spotify identity.  
- Melodex logout did **not** invalidate backend-stored Spotify tokens or clear related cookies.  
- `/auth/session` did not bind authorization state to the current Melodex user ID and instead relied solely on provider cookies.  
- Export initiation relied on stale session state and did not force a fresh validation when users switched.  
- Spotify OAuth callback (`/auth/callback`) used multiple `Set-Cookie` headers.  
  The second header (clearing `return_to`) overwrote the first header 
  (which contained `access` and `refresh` tokens).  
  As a result, Spotify tokens were never persisted in the browser, 
  causing `/auth/session` to report `connected:false` immediately after login.

## Changes
- Consolidated all Spotify OAuth `Set-Cookie` operations into a single header 
  in `/auth/callback` to ensure `access` and `refresh` tokens are actually stored.
- Updated `UserProfile` logout flow to call `/auth/revoke` before Cognito logout,
  ensuring Spotify tokens are cleared during Melodex account switches.
- Confirmed `/auth/session` now reflects accurate authorization state across 
  logout, navigation, and user switching.

## Verification
(To be completed after fix.)  
Initial verification steps will include:  
1. Log in as User A, complete Spotify OAuth.  
2. Log out, switch to User B.  
3. Start export; ensure Spotify prompts login.  
4. Verify `/auth/session` only returns `connected:true` once User B completes OAuth.  
5. After callback, confirm a second export does **not** trigger another OAuth prompt.

**Verification Status:** Pending
