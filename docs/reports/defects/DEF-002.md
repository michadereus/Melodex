# DEF-002 — Expired Deezer Preview Links in `/rankings`

## Summary  
Older Deezer preview URLs in `/rankings` fail to play, particularly for legacy accounts with aged ranking data. Freshly ranked songs work as expected, but older entries lose functionality over time.

## Environment  
- App: [Melodex](melodx.io)  
- commit: `9c876c9`  
- Browser(s): `Firefox 142.0.1 (Desktop)`  
- Device(s): `Windows 10 Desktop`  
- Network: `Spectrum (approx 450 up / 11 down)`  
- Date/Time: `09-14-2025`  

## Preconditions  
- Legacy account with ranking data created months ago  
- Main QA account with recent rankings also available  

## Steps to Reproduce  
1. Login with the **Legacy QA account**.  
2. Navigate to `/rankings`.  
3. Scroll to older ranked entries.  
4. Attempt to play audio preview.  

## Expected Result  
Audio preview should load and play reliably for both new and old ranked entries.  

## Actual Result  
- Many older songs fail to play (expired Deezer preview links).  
- Inconsistent enrichment: sometimes new previews only appear after re-ranking additional songs.  
- Console logs indicate attempt to refresh older songs, but results indicate failure.  
- Refreshing multiple times produces new broken songs, sometimes none.  

## Impact  
- Returning users may find much of their rankings unplayable.  
- Undermines trust in the ranking history feature.  
- May lead to frustration and drop-off for long-term users.

- Console log: [DEF-002-legacy-console](../evidence/DEF-002-legacy-console.txt)  

## Triage  
- Severity: **Major**  
- Priority: **High**  

## Suspected Areas  
- Deezer preview URLs expiring after a TTL.  
- Backend not refreshing metadata on `/rankings` load for older songs.  

## Diagnostics (what we tried)  
- Compared legacy vs. main QA account behavior.  
- Verified new rankings generate valid working preview links.  
- Observed enrichment failing to refresh on legacy account.  

## Proposed Fix (initial)  
- Implement backend enrichment step on `/rankings` load to refresh expired Deezer preview links.  
- Investigate Deezer API TTL policy and refresh cadence.

## Root Cause  
Deezer preview links are signed URLs with expiration timestamps. Older entries in MongoDB had stale URLs with no refresh mechanism, causing them to break over time. The frontend enrichment logic retried excessively but lacked throttling or persistence.  

## Fix Reference  
- Commit: `2b1a3fc`  
- PR: `#45`  

## Verification Steps (post-fix)  
1. Re-run steps with legacy account on `/rankings`.  
2. Confirm all previews (old + new) play without issue.  
3. Capture HAR/screenshot/logs as fresh evidence.
