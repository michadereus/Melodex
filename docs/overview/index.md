# Project Overview

Melodex is a music ranking web app with Rank, Re-Rank, and Rankings views. It uses AWS Amplify + Cognito + S3 on the frontend stack, an Express/Node backend on Elastic Beanstalk, MongoDB Atlas for persistence, OpenAI for candidate song generation, and Deezer for metadata and previews.
