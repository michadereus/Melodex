# Project Overview

## Purpose

This site presents a focused, end-to-end case study of the **Spotify Playlist Export** feature in Melodex.  
It documents how requirements were interpreted, tests were designed, defects were resolved, and the final feature was validated.

The emphasis is on QA engineering practices, not general product documentation.

## Audience

- QA / QE hiring managers
- Engineers reviewing test strategy and technical decisions
- Recruiters evaluating project depth and ownership

## In Scope

- User stories and acceptance criteria for playlist export
- Backend and frontend architecture relevant to export
- Test approach and planning
- Automation strategy (unit, integration, UI, E2E)
- Traceability and risk management
- Defects and fixes
- Final execution results and coverage
- Lessons learned

## Out of Scope

- Full product documentation for Melodex
- Non-Spotify features
- Deployment instructions
- Developer onboarding

## How to Navigate

Recommended order:

1. Requirements → Acceptance Criteria  
2. Test Approach and Test Plan  
3. Case Study (end-to-end narrative)  
4. Results and Lessons Learned

The repository holds the full implementation and test suite; this site is intentionally scoped to one feature as a portfolio artifact.
