# About These Docs

Purpose  
This site is a focused, end-to-end case study of the **Spotify Playlist Export** feature for Melodex. It highlights requirements, acceptance criteria, test approach/plan, automation, results, and lessons learned—optimized for QA/QE hiring managers.

Audience  
• Recruiters and hiring teams evaluating QA/QE skills  
• Engineers reviewing the approach and test assets

What’s in scope  
• User stories & acceptance criteria for the export feature  
• Test approach & plan (unit/integration/E2E, API, mobile web)  
• Traceability, risk log, exploratory charters, execution summary, defects  
• CI setup for docs and tests

What’s out of scope  
• Full product docs for Melodex (all features)  
• Non-Spotify features not part of this initiative

How to navigate  
Use the left navigation or the quick links on the home page. Start with “Requirements” → “Acceptance Criteria”, then “Test Approach”, “Test Plan”, and finally the “Case Study”.

Repository  
All code and docs live in the main repo. The docs are intentionally scoped to this feature to showcase a complete QA lifecycle.
