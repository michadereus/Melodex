# Melodex Spotify Playlist Export — Case Study

!!! info "Scope"
    This site documents the **Spotify Playlist Export** feature as a QA engineering case study.  
    It is not the full product documentation for Melodex. For source code and setup, see the repository README.

This documentation presents a focused case study of a real, production-grade feature developed inside Melodex. It covers requirements, design constraints, testing strategy, defects, execution results, and final outcomes.

The goal is to demonstrate how QA work scales across:
- Architecture
- Automation
- Documentation
- Risk management
- Defect handling
- CI/CD
